This is an MVP that provides ask and offer forms (that stop people from storing everyone's data in public spreadsheets), and provides a way to "match" people.
It's currently in "fully-moderated" mode, but we're working with a few groups to talk about what peer-to-peer could/should look like.
Has a bunch of CRM/admin tracking, etc, too.
